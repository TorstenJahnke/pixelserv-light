## 📞 For Customer Calls

### Opening (First 2 minutes)
```
"I help KRITIS organizations save €500K-€1M per year on security
by switching from CloudFlare and Cisco.

The reason is simple: they're proxies, so they have traffic limits.
When you scale to your size, those limits cost you millions in overages.

We're pure DNS. No limits. €9 per user per month, transparent.

Sound interesting? Let me show you how it works..."
```

### Middle (5-10 minutes)
```
[Show COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGE_TRAFFIC_LIMITS.md]

"Here's what CloudFlare's contract actually says about traffic limits.
Here's what other customers are actually paying.
Here's the savings you'd get with us..."
```

### Close (Last 5 minutes)
```
"Want to see this in action? 30-day free trial, full features.
Deploy on one test site, zero commitment.
You'll see threats blocked within hours.

Can we start Monday?"
